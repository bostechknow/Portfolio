# VSCode Devcontainers

VSCode devcontainers are a useful tool for developing locally while having a consistent, reproducible environment for your entire team.  This folder
contains a selection of devcontainers that I've used in the past.  They are mostly light weight and fairly simple.  However, they can be highly
customized and unique to a specific projects needs.
